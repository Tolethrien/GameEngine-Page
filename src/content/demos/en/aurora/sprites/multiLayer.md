## Multi-Layer

<br/>
In this demo, you will see how you can control and modify sprite layers.
<br/>
<br/>

Sprites can have multiple render layers that are sortable and can be dynamically changed one by one.
<br/>
<br/>
You can adjust various properties within these layers, such as color, offset from the main sprite, size, and more, based on what the sprite allows.

## Global Illumination

<br/>
In this demo, you will see how global lighting can be affected by adjusting the global color correction.
<br/>
<br/>

The global color correction is controlled by a timer that gradually changes the values of all three color channels from 0 to 1, making the world appear "darker."
<br/>
<br/>
Lights are scheduled to turn on as it gets darker and turn off again in the "morning."

## Force,Mass and Friction

<br/>
In this demo, you will see how mass affects the player's ability to move objects.
<br/>
<br/>

Crates with more mass are harder to push, while crates with less friction can easily slide across the ground.
<br/>
<br/>
Both mass and friction influence how the player interacts with these objects.
